Introduction to Bioinformatics
===

## Outline

* Each topic includes:
    * Implement a simple algorithm in python.
    * Use tools to analyze **target gene** and discuss the results.

* Try analyzing one gene from different aspects using tools from each topic.

* Midterm: finish **target gene** analysis up to course progress.
* Final exam: analyze another gene as student wish or selected from a list.
